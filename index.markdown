Welcome to my site!

I'm Stefano from Torino, Italy, and I'm a Swift dev.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/stefano_mondino_cat1.jpeg" alt="Living with cats" caption="Oh, yes, I live with four cats." %}

I'd like to share with you some of my day-by-day routines, coding problems and solutions I've found.

Currently I'm working at [Synesthesia](https://synesthesia.it), a Torino-based agency featuring a great *factory*, where I'm currently the *Mobile Platform Leader* (a.k.a. Mobile tech leader).

I've been working there since 2012, with my main focus on iOS apps, from small to huge sizes.

You can read more about me in the about section, I'll try not to be boring :)
